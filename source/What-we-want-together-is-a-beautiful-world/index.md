# What we want is a beautiful world together
I have not experienced everything, but a lot. I have experienced a lot troubles and aukward situations. I have lived through tough times. I know what good life means and I treasure them so much.   
I do not agree with those who persue only for their own happiness. It is not bad to work for oneself, while it is better to think about others and put the world in the first place. 
## Material do not make us happy
